The format of the sample ID is GTEX-[donor ID]-[tissue site ID]-SM-[aliquot ID]. 

10.20
Selected all human SLCs from RNA seq dataframe with filter.py 

10.22
We first focus on differential expression pattern between 2 tissue, the ID of 
which are 0126 and 0326

10.24
Don't know why, but it seems that the [tissue site ID] is not specific to a 
tissue. We now test Ovary and Testis so there's only one gender in each group.

10.26
The top one differentially expressed gene SLC36A3 was reported to be restricted 
in Testis
Ref: DOI: 10.1007/s00335-003-2319-3

10.27
Drew a boxplot instead of violin plot for normalized counts as there are two many
groups to show. Also drew a volcano plot to visualize DE genes

To do list

Analyse heart, ovary, and testis counts data to identify co-expression genes, 
highly expressed genes and the take age, gender into account. Volcano and violin 
plot may be useful. Then analyse GO terms or Mesh? to check if there's specific 
small molecules bind to those genes and disease relateed ot it
